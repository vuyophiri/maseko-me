## What This Milestone Represents

Reaching this milestone represents more than just professional progress—it’s a moment of personal growth. It’s a sign that the dedication and passion I’ve invested are paying off. Whether it’s mastering a new skill, taking on leadership responsibilities, or completing a major project, this achievement is a reminder that perseverance, curiosity, and a love for what I do are key drivers of success.

## The Challenges That Shaped Me

Of course, no journey is without its hurdles. There were moments of doubt, failed prototypes, and unforeseen obstacles that tested my resolve. However, those challenges taught me the importance of adaptability, creative thinking, and collaboration. They pushed me to improve, to think outside the box, and to view setbacks not as failures, but as opportunities to learn and grow.

As design engineers, we're often defined by the 1% of our work that makes it into the final product. That shiny, polished piece of engineering is a result of countless iterations, tweaks, and redesigns. But what happens to the other 99%—those ideas, concepts, and prototypes that never see the light of day? They remain tucked away in the drawer, both literally and figuratively.

## The Beauty of Unused Ideas

It’s easy to think of discarded designs as failures, but in truth, they’re stepping stones. Each one represents a path explored, tested, and ultimately left behind. Those early drafts may never become reality, but they play a crucial role in shaping the solution that does. They teach us what works and, more importantly, what doesn’t.

## The Process of Elimination

In every project, the first few ideas often come quickly. They’re intuitive, straightforward, and sometimes too simple. As we dive deeper, we explore more creative solutions, test the limits of materials and technology, and challenge the initial assumptions. This process of elimination is not about rejecting ideas but about refining them. The 99% left in the drawer is evidence of rigorous thinking and thorough exploration.

## Why the Drawer Matters

For every concept that didn’t make it, there’s a lesson learned. A sketch that looked promising might fail in prototyping. A concept that seemed impractical might be revisited years later, finding new relevance with advancements in technology or a change in project scope. These shelved ideas serve as a knowledge base—a library of possibilities for future projects.

## Innovation Through Failure

Many breakthrough innovations are born from revisiting old, seemingly failed concepts. What didn’t work in one context might be the key to solving a problem in another. As design engineers, we should never be afraid to open the drawer and revisit those shelved ideas. They are a testament to the iterative nature of design, where nothing is truly wasted.

## Final Thoughts

The final product is just the tip of the iceberg—the visible 1%. The other 99% may never see the spotlight, but they are just as important. They represent the trial and error, the persistence, and the creative drive that push us to find the best solution. So next time you’re stuck or looking for inspiration, don’t be afraid to dig into the drawer. The answer might be hiding there, waiting for the right moment to shine.10:Tab7,
## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.

## Key Features

- **Figma Plugin Integration**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **Code Generation**: Integrated an automated process that translates Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and pre-built component templates. This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.
- **Continuous Sync**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Scalable Design System**: Leveraged a design system that remains the single source of truth for both designers and developers, making it easy to maintain consistency even as the product evolves.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: For extracting design tokens and component data directly from the Figma designs.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
